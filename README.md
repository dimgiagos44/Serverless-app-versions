# Serverless-app-versions

Main repository for Master thesis on serverless.

## Description
* In [functions](https://github.com/dimgiagos44/Serverless-app-versions/tree/main/functions) directory there exist 4 versions of the same ML Workflow
* Each version consists of functions of different granularity
* Version1 is the most fine-grained, while Version4 is the most coarse-grained of the versions
* After deploying all the functions, by using the [exec script](https://github.com/dimgiagos44/Serverless-app-versions/blob/main/exec.sh)
we can run the desired instance on our local cluster as many times as we like in a sequential way of invocations
```
./exec.sh version1 url1 --times=10 yes yes --sleep=5s --step=15s
```
* We can scale each function's replicas up or down so as to make the versions capable
of serving more or less requests per minute
```
kubectl scale deployment version1 -n openfaas-fn --replicas=2
```
## Benchmarking

### Average results from version1 vs version4 with 4 different inputs with single node deployment (davinci)
*Adding replicas to Version1's pods seems not to accelerate the execution.*

* Url1's duration = 180 seconds (0-180) with total 11 frames created & processed (1 per 15 seconds)
* Url4's duration = 280 seconds (0-280) with total 18 frames created & processed (1 per 15 seconds)
* Url5's duration = 500 seconds (0-500) with total 26 frames created & processed (1 per 15 seconds)
* Url6's duration = 500 seconds (0-500) with total 78 frames created & processed (1 per 5 seconds)

### Average results from version1 vs version2 vs version3 vs version4 with 1 input with single node (davinci)
*Expected result for each version's time.*

* Url6's duration = 500 seconds (0-500) with total 78 frames created & processed (1 per 5 seconds)

### Average results from version1. Single and Multi-node deployment, 3 replicas for facedetector-faceanalyzer-mobilenet
* Url1's duration = 180 seconds (0-180) with total 11  frames created & processed (1 per 15 seconds)
* Url4's duration = 280 seconds (0-280) with total 18  frames created & processed (1 per 15 seconds)
* Url5's duration = 500 seconds (0-500) with total 26  frames created & processed (1 per 15 seconds)
* Url6's duration = 500 seconds (0-500) with total 78  frames created & processed (1 per 5 seconds)
* Url7's duration = 654 seconds (0-654) with total 130 frames created & processed (1 per 5 seconds)

### Average results from version1 (single/multi-node) vs version4 (no pressures applied)
1. *The weird thing here is that multi-replicas deployments are not faster than the single-replica deployment*
2. *Version4 monolithic version scales way better mainly because of reduced traffic generated by faas-flow during its execution*

### Average results for Version1(1, 3 replicas) for single-node deployment: Davinci VS Liono
*This was done to check whether some of the machines are stronger than others*

### CPU-MemBandwidth-LLC pressure scenarios for Version1 (single/multi-node) and Version4

| Single-node placement | Multi-node placement |
| --- | --- |
| All functions &rarr; davinci | framer, mobilenet, version1b &rarr; davinci |
|  | facedetector, outputer &rarr; liono |
|  | faceanalyzer &rarr; coroni |
